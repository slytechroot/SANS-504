False attribution - making your malware seem like it belongs or was created by someone else.
For instance, the US government making it seem as if their tools were created by the Chinese government.

PII - personal identifiable information
PHI - personal health information

Lookup GRR - google rapid response

Binary image - creationg software:

Forensic software:
Sleuth Kit and Autopsy (free at sleuthkit.org)
EnCase (commercial software from Guidance Software)
Forensics Toolkit (commercial software from AccessData)
X-Ways Forensics software (commercial)
Others

Diagnosis software you can trust:
Statically linked binary executables from a write-once media (CD or DVD)
Attackers often change built-in programs to lie to system admins and hide the attackers' tracks

Rootkits by definition alter the trusted components of OS software to give an attacker stealthy control:
- we advise against the use of bootable Windows PE environments
- most of them change the hard drive and contaminate evidence
- instead, use a good bootable Linux environment, such as SIFT

The SANS Investigative Forensics TOolKit (SIFT) image can be helpful:

- this VMware appliance includes numerous analysis tools:
Sleuth Kit
log2timeline
Wireshark
Volatility
ssdeep and md5deep
Numerous others!!!

Get USB Token RAM device (at least 16 Gig)
External hard drive USB2/3 and possibly Firewire and Thunderbolt
Ethernet TAP (4-8 ports preferable, 100/1000 Mbps), don't get a switch, taps are preferred (NetOptics are popular)
Patch cables (2 straight-through, and one crossover)
USB cables and serial cables for routers and other network equipment
Laptop with multiple operating systems

Have the system administrators look for unusual:
Processes and services
Files
Network usage
Scheduled tasks
Accounts
Log Entries
Other unusual items
Additional supporting (third-party) tools

Show autostart program with WMIC:
wmic startup list full

look for unexpected accounts in the Administrators group:
lusrmgr.msc

check for very large files:
FOR /R c:\ %i in (*) do @if %~zi gtr 10000000 echo %i %~zi

Scheduled tasks:
better to check with:
schtasks
, because it will show also jobs created with other programs such as 'at' and not just with Scheduled Tasks.
check logs:
eventvwr.msc



eventquery.vbs /L security

wevtutil qe security /f:text

Tools for mapping listening TCP/UDP ports with:
TCPView: Free

Use WINDOWS 10 for the virtual machine to run the commands!!!

Check processes on your computer:
taskmgr.exe
tasklist /v
wmic process list full

services.msc
sc query | more
tasklist /svc

schtasks | more

net localgroup administrators

Log Entries with:
secpol.msc

Local Policies - Audit Policy - Audit Logon Events - select Failure

and then generate a security event

- run the Event Viewer - check the Security log or Windows logs and Security
- generate an avent running 'runas /user:administror cmd.exe", type a bogus password in when asked for a password.
- look at your Event Viewer and Hit refresh (F5 key)

There's a challenge .exe script in the C:\Tools Directory called 504lab.exe, that will emulate a compromised system.

Unusual Network Usage:
net view \\127.0.0.1
net session
net use
nbtstat -S
netstat -na
netstat -na 5
netstat -nao 5

netsh firewall show config
netsh advfirewall show currentprofile

Unusual Processes:
tasklist
wmic process list full
wmic process get name,parentprocessid,processid

tasklist /m /fi "pid eq [pid]" 
wmic process where processid=[pid] get commandline

- beware of base64 decoding tools online!

Unusual Services:
services.msc
net start
sc query | more
tasklist /svc

Unusual Reg Key Entries:
reg query hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run

Check Startup Items:
dir /s /b "c:\documents and settings\[username]\Start Menu\"
dir /s /b "c:\users\[user_name]\Start Menu\"

- show autostartup programs:
wmic startup list full


Find Parent ID of process:
C:\> wmic process get processid,parentprocessid,executablepath|find "process id goes here"

Kill process with WMIC:
wmic process [pid] delete

Find the PID of a powershell like process, with no open port:
wmic process where (name like "powershell%") list brief

disable your firewall:
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off

Efficient handling of errors is part of the process!

When looking at the situation, you need to determine how much damage could be caused:
How widely deployed is the affected platform or applications?
What is the effect of vulnerability exploitation, if a vulnerability is present?
What is the value of the systems impacted so far? What is the value of the data on those systems?
Can the vulnerability be exploited remotely (via a network connection)?
Is a public exploit available? Was one recently released?

Ask yourself:
what level of skill and prerequisites are required by an attacker to exploit the vulnerability?
Is the vulnerability present in a default configuration? 
Is a fix available for the vuln?
Do other factors exist that reduce or increase the vuln's risk or potential impact, such as the possibility it is a worm?

Letty Zeltser has prepared an Initial Security Incident Questionnaire for Responders:
http://zeltser.com/network-os-security/security-incident-questionnaire-cheat-sheet.html

BE CAREFUL:
Do NOT delete ANY files until the case is closed out, and even then if you have storage space, save them for a document retention timeframe approved by your legal team. 
Identify every piece of evidence in your notebook.
Control access to evidence.

Each piece of evidence must be under the control of one identified person at all times:
Include a lined page with the evidence to record all hands-offs: who an when! 
Record when you lock it up in storage.

When turning over evidence to law enforcement, have the sign for it!

504.1 - Incident Handling Step-by Step & Comp Crime Investigation/1.5 Incident Handling Phase Three Containment/

CyberCPR - tool - free up to 3 users!

Local handlers should keep making reports to the command center as they gather and analyze evidence!

WordWebBugs to track the attacker!

1.6 Incident Handling Phase Four Eradication:

Malware on a system is a sympthom, but how the attacker got in the system in the first place, is the root cause!

The business unit decides whether to keep the compromised system on or not! you can only recommend!


1.7 Incident Handling Phase Five Recovery:
The window to recover and ask for money after an incident is for 3 months!

To and when to restore from backup and to restore operations, put that decision into the hands of the business and system owners.
Provide your advice, but they make the final call! Document your advice in a signed memo!

Monitor the system when is back online. Continue to monitor for backdoors that escaped detection!
Utilize network and host-based IDS and IPS.
Carefully check operating system and application logs!

Look for the attacker's artifacts that helped the attacker get in, in the first place!

Never name names and play the blame game! Keep it as impersonal as possible! 
Always look at what procedure, security, failsafe failed or that led to the compromise!

Have a meeting as soon as practical (within two weeks of resuming production).
Review the report!
Finalize Executive Summary!
Keep it short and professional (max length: half day).

Based on what you learned, get appropriate approval and funding to fix: your process, your technology, improved incident-handling capabilities!



1.9 Enterprise-Wide Identification and Analysis:
- check connection logs, DNS cache, Web proxy
- dump your current DNS cache and let it rebuild for 1 month, then run the dns-blacklists.py and you can find malware on your network.


"if you try to see everything, you will see nothing!"
Be smart about finding the bad guys in your network, when you look for them!

Look up RITA (real intelligence threat analysis)

Pull Information:
wmic product get name, version
wmic /node:@systems.txt product get description,name,vendor /format:csv > SoftwareInventory.txt

the /node:@systems.txt allows you to run the same command on multiple systems!

Learn SCCM! It has a feature to do an inventory of all the software installed on your company wide computers!

Don't do incident response on 5000 endpoints in your organization! Do incident response on network segments! Do one segment at a time!

Let's focus on Kansa, which is an excellent detection tool from Dave Hull!


Kansa focuses on stacking like systems against each other to provide a ranked listing of processes, network connections, and configurations of systems! This is all part of statistical long-tail analysis!
For functionality, install Handle.exe and autorunssc.exe from Sysinternals from Microsoft.
For the machine launching the scripts, install LogParser from Microsoft.
On all target systems, run the following command to enable Windows Remote Management:
c:\winrm quickconfig
Add all hosts you want checked into a text file and loaded in the Kansa-Master directory!
Kansa supports the ability to pull the total count for specific things, such as Auto Start Entry Points (ASEP).
In the following example, notice the count column on the left side, which contains MD5 hashes. These can be checked on websites, to make sure they have not been modified!

.\kansa.ps1 -Targetlist .\hosts.txt -ModulePath .\Modules -verbose -Analysis

Look for things that are different and things that show up only on a few systems! Use Kansa to look for these things!

#########################
Lab questions:
Have we been compromised?
Which system has been compromised?
How was it most likely compromised?
Who is the user on that system?
Are any other systems at risk?
What are our containment next steps?

Hints:
Excel or another spreadsheet helps, but is not necessary.
You do not have to know every field of every log file
Look for patterns
Work as a team... Sometimes talking through what you see helps!

Full walkthrough of all evidence is on the following slides!

Look up a tool called Mandiant Redline!

If a process was started by explorer.exe, it means someone/the user clicked it!

Lookup in exploitdb U3D and flatedecode for Adobe PDF! You should be able to also find these in metasploit!

In 504.5 will will revisit this case mentioned with Rekall memory analysis!
SANS has great Windows Memory Forensics in depth courses!

######################

Check CyberCrimes in other countries:
http://www.hg.org/computer-crime.html

Check Logins:
wmic computersystem get username

wmic /node:@systems.txt computersystem get username /format:csv > 504_Target_LoggedIn.txt


Checking Drives:
USB drives
Pull Historical USB usage with the following query:
reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR

Or:
wmic diskdrive get interfacetype, mediatype, model

or:

wmic /node:@systems.txt diskdrive get interfacetype,mediatype,model /format:csv > 504_Target_usb.txt


Monitor things like logons, file access (sensitive files), drive usage with tools like Nagios, Tripwire, and SCCM in enterprises!
Disable Windows firewall:
netsh firewall set opmode disable

netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off


or for Linux:
#iptables -F

###############################

Logging in as Root Versus non-root (useradd):
#useradd -d homedir login

change password:
#passwd
or
#passwd [login]

Remember to do everything as a non-root user, except for things you truly need root for!
If you need root:
$sudo su - 
type your own password

$whoami

#service --status-all

look for running processes:
#ps aux

investigate unusuall processes, getting more detail by using:
lsof -p [pid]
- shows all files and ports used by running processes

Sometimes an attacker runs a backdoor or stashes some data on a machine and unlinks it so that it doesn't appear in the normal directory structure. We can find such files using:
#lsof +L1
(shows files with a link count less than 1 (that's 0 to you and me)

On a Debian Linux, run the debsums tool to verify packages:
#debsums

Check size, MD5 sum, permissions, type, owner, and group of each file with information from package database. Pay attention to changes associated with items in /sbin, /bin, /usr/bin.

Unusual Network Usage:
#lsof -i
#netstat -nap
#arp -a

Look for cron jobs scheduled by root and any other UID 0 accounts:
#crontab -l -u root

Look for unusual system-wide cron jobs:
#cat /etc/crontab
#ls /etc/cron.*

Unusual accounts
- Look in /etc/passwd for new accounts, sorted from lowest to highest UID:
#sort /etc/passwd -nk3 -t: | less

Also look for UID and GID 0 accounts:
#grep :0: /etc/passwd

- normal accounts will be there, but look for new, unexpected accounts!

As a final measure, look for files whose owner UID isn't assigned to a user!
Sloppy attackers frequently create a temporary user, install a bunch of files (possibly owned by the user) and then delete that user to clean up.
They leave the files with a non-existent user as the owner:
#find / -nouser -print

Check for resource utilization of the system!
First, the system load (CPU particularly)
$uptime

Next the utilization of memory:
$free
Finally, it's useful to check available hard-drive space:
$df



- use Chkrootkit for anomalies on systems introduced by user-mode and kernel-mode RootKits
- use TripWire to look for changes to critical system files
- AIDE looks for changes to critical system files
- CIS Hardening Guidelines provide a starting point for secure system configuration

Unusual Files - SUID Root:
#cd /tmp
#cp /bin/sh /tmp/backdoor
(any user who runs this program is given root access):
#chmod 4111 /tmp/backdoor
(look for SUID files):
#find /tmp -uid 0 -perm -4000 -print
(then remove the backdoor):
#rm /tmp/backdoor

Unusual Files - Unlinked:
#cp /tmp
#cp /home/tools/netcat/nc /tmp/nc
#/tmp/nc -l -p 2222 &
#ls /tmp/nc -l
#unlink /tmp/nc
#ls /tmp/nc -l
#ps aux | grep /tmp/nc
#lsof +L1
#killall nc

Network Usage - "lsof -i"
#nc -l -p 2222 &
#lsof -Pi

Unusual UID 0 Accounts:
- look for UID 0 accounts with grep
- create a new UID 0 account called test with useradd
- look for UID 0 accounts again with grep
#grep :0: /etc/passwd
#useradd -i -u 0 -s /sbin/nologin test
#grep :0: /etc/passwd

Sorting Accounts:
- run the sort command and look for your test account
- delete your test account when finished
#sort /etc/passwd -nk3 -t: | less
#userdel -r test


Unusual Log Entries:
- run tcpdump to force the interface into promiscuous mode
- look in /var/log messages with grep to see promisc log entry
#tcpdump host 10.10.75.1 &
#grep promisc /var/log/messages
#killall tcpdump
